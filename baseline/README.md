# Shared Task on Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT)

We invite researchers and practitioners to participate in the **Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) Shared Task**, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, specifically news articles and academic writing.

## Task Overview

The task aims to distinguish human-written content from AI-generated text, a critical challenge for maintaining information integrity and academic honesty.

### Subtasks

Participants can develop models for one or both of the following subtasks:

A. **News Article Detection (NAD)**:
   - Binary classification of news articles as human-written or AI-generated.
   - Evaluation across various news genres and article lengths.

B. **Academic Writing Detection (AWD)**:
   - Binary classification of academic texts, including student coursework and research papers.
   - Coverage of multiple disciplines and writing styles.

## Dataset

- **Human-written content**: Sourced from verified news platforms and academic samples.
- **AI-generated content**: Produced using advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude.
- **Balanced distribution** of human and AI-generated texts.

### Dataset Statistics

- **Training set**: 10,000 samples per subtask.
- **Development set**: 2,000 samples per subtask.
- **Test set**: 3,000 samples per subtask.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Primary Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall.
- **Secondary Analysis**: Model robustness across different text types, domains, and AI models.

## Timeline

- **Training Data Ready**: March 15, 2024
- **Evaluation Data Ready**: April 15, 2025
- **Evaluation Period**: April 22 - April 30, 2025
- **Results and Paper Submission**: May 16, 2025
- **Shared Task Presentation**: Co-located with RANLP 2025 on September 11-12, 2025
