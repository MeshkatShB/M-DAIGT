# Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT)

## Task Description
The **Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT)** shared task focuses on identifying AI-generated content across different domains, particularly **news articles** and **academic writing**. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), distinguishing human-written and AI-generated text has become a critical challenge. This task aims to contribute to research on information integrity and academic honesty.

## Subtasks

### 1. News Article Detection (NAD)
- Binary classification of news articles as **human-written** or **AI-generated**
- Evaluation on both **full articles** and **snippets**
- Covers various genres: **politics, technology, sports**, etc.

### 2. Academic Writing Detection (AWD)
- Binary classification of academic texts as **human-written** or **AI-generated**
- Evaluation on **student coursework** and **research papers**
- Covers multiple **academic disciplines and writing styles**

## Dataset

### Data Collection and Annotation
- **Human-written content**: Sourced from verified **news websites** and academic papers with proper permissions.
- **AI-generated content**: Created using multiple LLMs (**GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, etc.**) with different **prompting strategies and generation settings**.

### Dataset Statistics
| Split            | Samples per Subtask |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Training**   | 10,000           |
| **Development** | 2,000            |
| **Test**       | 3,000            |

- **Balanced distribution** of human-written and AI-generated text.

## Evaluation Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **F1-score**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**

### Secondary Analysis
- Model robustness across different:
  - **Text lengths**
  - **Writing styles**
  - **Topic domains**
  - **Generation models**
